# Learning Management System (LMS) - Entity-Relationship Diagram

This repository contains the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) design for a Learning Management System (LMS). The design is presented at three levels:

1. Conceptual Design - High-level overview of entities and relationships
2. Logical Design - Normalized database structure with primary and foreign keys
3. Physical Design - SQL implementation schema with data types and constraints

## Project Overview

This Learning Management System is designed to support online education with features including:

- User management (students, instructors, administrators)
- Course management
- Assignment and submission tracking
- Learning material organization
- Discussion forums
- Notification system

## ERD Documentation

The ERD is documented in the following files:

- [ERD Design Documentation](ERD_Design_Documentation.md) - Detailed descriptions of entities, relationships, and attributes
- [ERD Diagrams](ERD_Diagrams.md) - Visual representations of the database design at all three levels

## Implementation Guide

### Database Setup

1. Choose a DBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
2. Execute the SQL scripts in the Physical Design section of [ERD Design Documentation](ERD_Design_Documentation.md)
3. Set up appropriate indexes for performance optimization

### Key Relationships

- **Users and Courses**: Many-to-many relationship through Enrollments table
- **Courses and Materials**: One-to-many relationship
- **Assignments and Submissions**: One-to-many relationship with user attribution
- **Discussions and Posts**: Hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships

### Security Considerations

- Passwords should be stored as hashes using a secure algorithm
- Implement appropriate access controls based on user roles
- Protect against SQL injection and other common security threats

### Performance Optimization

- Utilize the defined indexes for common queries
- Consider caching frequently accessed data
- Implement pagination for large result sets

## Database Schema Highlights

### Core Tables

- **Users**: Central entity for all system users
- **Courses**: Educational offerings with instructor relationships
- **Enrollments**: Connects users to courses
- **Assignments**: Tasks created for courses
- **Submissions**: Student work submitted for assignments

### Supporting Tables

- **Materials**: Learning resources for courses
- **Discussions**: Course-related forum topics
- **DiscussionPosts**: Individual messages in discussions
- **Notifications**: System-generated alerts for users

## Future Enhancements

- Calendar integration
- Grading scale customization
- Learning analytics
- Integration with external systems
- Mobile app support
